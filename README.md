# HHR Quant Research – Market Data Usage

## About
I am an individual quantitative researcher building a personal research system (“HHR”) for foreign exchange market analysis, backtesting, and model evaluation.

## Intended Use of Dukascopy Data
- Historical FX price data ingestion (candles; bid/ask or spread if available)
- Research, validation, and reproducible backtesting on my local machine
- No redistribution or resale of Dukascopy data
- Compliance with Dukascopy terms, licensing requirements, and rate limits

## Data Handling
- Data stored locally for research only
- Access restricted to me
- Any published results will be aggregated statistics, not raw data
